## End to End mapping of postage delivery nodes in india

#### Smart India Hackathon 2018 runner up

The project is aimed at calculating the estimated time of arrival of a consignment at the time of booking through speedpost and also to minimize it. The algorithm used for determining the path of transit is a modified Djikstraâ€™s algorithm to fit the hub and spoke model of the indian postal network. The estimation of delivery time deploys a regression based machine learning model trained on the historical postage dataset and is able to predict the time of arrival with a confidence of more than 96%.
